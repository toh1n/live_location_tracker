Create a Flutter app that achieves the following tasks:
1. Automatic Map Animation:
 - Display a Google Map view that smoothly animates to the user's current location.
     
2. Real-Time Location Updates:
 - Fetch the user's current location every 10 seconds.
 - Update the marker's position on the map to reflect the latest location.

3. Polyline Tracking:
 - Draw a polyline on the map connecting the previous and current locations.
 - Keep updating the polyline as the user's location changes.

4. Marker Information Window:
- Allow users to tap the marker to open an info window.
- Display an info window with "My current location" as the title and the user's latitude and longitude as the snippet.
